## Info
Please do not use the program maliciously. This program is intended to be used for educational purposes only. Mercurial is only used to demonstrate what type of information attackers can grab from a user's computer. This project was created to make it easier for malware analysts or ordinary users to understand how credential grabbing works and can be used for analysis, research, reverse engineering, or review.

## What is malware?
Malware is a term that is used for malicious software that is designed to do damage or unwanted actions to a computer system.

## An explanation of this tool:
Google Chrome always stores user data in the same place, so the stealer generated by Mercurial Grabber has no problem finding it. In theory at least, this data is stored in encrypted form. However, if the malware has already penetrated the system, then its actions are done in your name.

Therefore, the malware simply finds a way to decrypt information stored on your computer (by making it seem like the user is requesting it). The stealer gets all your passwords and cookies.
